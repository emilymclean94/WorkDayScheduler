# WorkDayScheduler

## Description
An application to keep track of your daily To-Dos by the hour from 9am-5pm. The current date is displayed in the header of the page. Grey boxes indicate hours that have passed, red indicates the current hour, and green indicates future hours. All text written in the application is saved to local storage so the user can refresh or close out of the webpage without losing their data. There is a save button for each hour so the user can change their tasks individually.

## Usage
